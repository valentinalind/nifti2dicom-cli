qnifti2dicom - Convert 3D medical images to DICOM 2D series (GUI)
[description]
.B QNifti2Dicom
is a conversion tool that converts 3D NIfTI files (and other
formats supported by ITK) to DICOM.
Unlike other conversion tools, it can import a DICOM file that is used
to import the patient and study DICOM tags, and allows you to edit the
accession number and other DICOM tags, in order to create a valid DICOM
that can be imported in a PACS.

.B QNifti2Dicom
was primarily written by Daniele E. Domenichelli and Gabriele Arnulfo.

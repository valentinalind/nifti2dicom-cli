/*!
 * \brief A class that handles DICOM tags related to Series
 *
 * The following tags are handled by this class:
 *
 * \li (0020,0013) Instance Number
 * \li (0018|0050) Slice Thickness
 *
 * Also handles:
 *
 * \li ITK_NumberOfDimensions
 * \li ITK_Origin
 * \li ITK_Spacing
 * \li ITK_ZDirection
 *
 * These "ITK_" tags are used by itkGDCMImageIO to know 3D information of a 2D slice but maybe in the future they'll be handled by itkSeriesWriter.
 * \note In future this class could be unuseful because handled by ITK + GDCM2 or maybe ITK will set correctly ITK_ tags.
 * \note ITK_ZDirection is not supported by ITK at the moment, a patch was submitted to support it.
